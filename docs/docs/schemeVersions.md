# Blowfish-based scheme

## Versions

The library supports the following scheme versions:

> Niels Provos and David Mazières designed a crypt() scheme called bcrypt based on Blowfish, and presented it at USENIX in 1999.[14]

The printable form of these hashes starts with $2$, $2a$, $2b$, $2x$ or $2y$ depending on which variant of the algorithm is used:

```text
$2$ – Currently obsolete
$2a$ – The current key used to identify this scheme.
       Since a major security flaw was discovered in 2011 in a third-party implementation of the algorithm,
       hashes indicated by this string are now ambiguous and might have been generated by the flawed
       implementation, or a subsequent fixed, implementation.
       The flaw may be triggered by some password strings containing non-ASCII characters, such as specially
       crafted password strings.
$2b$ – Used by some recent implementations which include a mitigation to a wraparound problem.
       Previous versions of the algorithm have a problem with long passwords. By design, long passwords
       are truncated at 72 characters, but there is an 8-bit wraparound problem with certain password
       lengths resulting in weak hashes.
$2x$ – Post-2011 bug discovery, old hashes can be renamed to be $2x$ to indicate that they were generated with
       the broken algorithm. These hashes are still weak, but at least it's clear which algorithm was used to
       generate them.
$2y$ – Post Post-2011 bug discovery, $2y$ may be used to unambiguously use the new, corrected algorithm. On an
       implementation suffering from the bug, $2y$ simply won't work. On a newer, fixed implementation, it will
       produce the same result as using $2a$.
```

First and foremost this library originated as a port of jBCrypt from `mindrot`, and subsequently the bcrypt revision
was set to match, which in this case is `$2a$`.
This has been changed as handling only the single revision causes issues cross-platform with implementations that moved
altered their revision to handle migrations and other issues.

```text

The original bcrypt code (released in OpenBSD 2.1) identified itself as
$2$. Shortly after release, a bug was fixed and the hash identifier
changed to $2a$. Support for "minor" versions wasn't really
planned, but it was backwards compatible.

Solar Designer wrote a second implementation of bcrypt. This
reimplementation suffered from a flaw dealing with 8 bit characters
and led to the introduction of the 'x' and 'y' flavours. OpenBSD did
not have this problem and supports neither 'x' nor 'y' hash versions.

---

Solar found a bug in their OpenBSD implementation of bcrypt when hashing
long passwords. The length is stored in an unsigned char type, which
will overflow and wrap at 256. Although we consider the existence of
affected hashes very rare, in order to differentiate hashes generated
before and after the fix, we are introducing a new minor 'b'.

OpenBSD 5.5 (coming this spring) will accept and verify 'b' hashes,
although it will still generate 'a' hashes. OpenBSD 5.6 (coming this
fall) will change to generating 'b' hashes by default.

A future release of Solar's bcrypt code should also support 'b'.
```

**There is no difference between 2a, 2x, 2y, and 2b. They all output the same result.**
